==================================================
1. To build MorIARTy from the sources
==================================================

1.1. Download MorIARTy source archive and extract MorIARTy-toolbox source tree.

1.2. Start Scilab and change directory to MorIARTy-toolbox:

    cd MorIARTy-toolbox

1.3. Build MorIARTy in Scilab:

    exec builder.sce;

==================================================
2. To start MorIARTy
==================================================

Start Scilab, change directory to MorIARTy-toolbox and execute "loader.sce"
scenario:

    cd MorIARTy-toolbox
    exec loader.sce;

==================================================
3. Make MorIARTy load at every Scilab startup
==================================================

To make Scilab load MorIARTy every time Scilab is starting up add the following
lines to Scilab startup scenario "scilab.start" located in <Scilab_root>/etc
directory:

    exec("<full_path_to_MorIARTy-toolbox>/loader.sce");

NOTE: <Scilab_root> is the value of Scilab variable "SCI", usually
"/usr/share/scilab" on Linux.

NOTE: Usually Scilab toolboxes are located in <Scilab_root>/contrib directory.
So it will be better to place MorIARTy-toolbox into that directory if you decide
to add it to Scilab permanently.
